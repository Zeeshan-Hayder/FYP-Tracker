# FYP Tracker

## Overview

Managing final-year projects (FYPs) in an academic setting can be incredibly challenging. Project managers are tasked with overseeing multiple student groups simultaneously, each with unique requirements and schedules. This involves:

- Tracking attendance
- Weekly evaluations of individual groups
- Assessing group assignments
- Monitoring each group's performance weekly and overall
- Gaining a comprehensive view of all groups they are managing
- Maintaining open lines of communication
- Accessing yearly reports to identify student participation and technology trends

Students, on the other hand, face their own set of challenges. They need an efficient platform to monitor their performance, submit weekly work, and communicate with their project managers. The current approach, which involves managing these tasks separately, is inefficient and time-consuming.
